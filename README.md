MPI-actor
=========

This is an MPI based actor model library.
It supports multiple actors being executed on multiple processes,
with no hard limit on either the number of actors or the number of processes.

This was written for a project as part of
the MSc in HPC by EPCC in the University of Ediburgh.
An example implementation is provided in the `example/` directory.
It is a simplstic model of the spread of blue nose disease through
a population of frogs.
The accompanying report may also provide some insight
to how the library may be used.
